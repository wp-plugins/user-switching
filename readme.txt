Instant switching between user accounts in WordPress, WordPress Multisite, and WordPress MU.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to quickly swap between user accounts in WordPress at the click of a button. You'll be instantly logged out and logged in as your desired user. This is handy for test environments where you regularly log out and in between different accounts, or for adminstrators of blogs with multiple accounts who need to switch between them.

= Features =

 * Instant switching and redirection to the WordPress Dashboard.
 * Instant switching back to the originating account.
 * It's completely secure (see the "Security" section below).
 * Compatible with WordPress, WordPress Multisite, and WordPress MU.

= Security =

 * Only administrators can switch to another user. Lower level users cannot switch between accounts.
 * User switching is protected with the WordPress nonce security system, meaning only those who are allowed to switch users can switch.
 * Full support for administration over SSL (if applicable).
 * Passwords are not (and cannot be) revealed.

== Installation ==

If you're installing this in WordPress MU as a mu-plugin then see the FAQ for slightly different instructions.

1. Unzip the ZIP file and drop the folder straight into your 'wp-content/plugins' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu.
3. Visit the 'Users' menu and you'll see a 'Switch To' link right next to each user.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with WordPress Multisite? =

Yes.

= Does this plugin work in WordPress MU? =

Yes.

= Does this plugin work as a mu-plugin in WordPress MU? =

Yes, except you'll need to install the 'user-switching.php' file into the root of your mu-plugins directory, not in the 'user-switching' subdirectory. This is a limitation of WordPress MU, not this plugin.
